=======================

Python3 solution to triangle puzzle.

I wanted to re-write the Java solution I wrote last year in Python3. This is that puzzle where one must solve the best path down (based on highest value of digits in the path) for a file of numbers that forms a binary tree.

I kept track of the path and printed it all out in the solution.txt.
